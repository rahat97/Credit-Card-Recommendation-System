# Bitbucket Contribution Tutorial

Assuming the repository has already been cloned to your local machine run following commands after cd-ing to the folder.

``` git pull```

Git pull will pull all the changes that has been made from the time you cloned the repository (aka folder) to current time to your local machine.

then 

```git add . ```

This command tells git to track all the new files added to the repository. This means git will now track all the new files and keep version histories for these new files.

then do

``` git commit -m "commit message"```

In the commit message part write short description of the work you have done. Committing means you are adding the current snapshot of the repository to version history.

finally

```git push```

this will send the changes made to bitbucket.
